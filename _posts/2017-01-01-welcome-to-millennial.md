##The Need
The pandemic has disrupted life for everyone, but it has had a particularly harsh impact on our
neighbors in need â€“ many of whom were already struggling with access to healthy and nutritious
meals. 


People have lost their jobs, schools have shut their doors and all of us have been forced to live in
constant fear of catching the virus. Life has forever changed in more ways than any of us can imagine
today.

##The Mission
Although we wish we could solve everyone's problems, we recognize that is an impossible task. Instead, we
aim to alleviate the stresses related to feeding our families. After all, no matter the size of your army,
before you can go to battle, you first need breakfast


**Please support our mission in whatever way you can to keep our children happy and healthy!**
