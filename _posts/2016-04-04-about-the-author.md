Becca Menzer founded Food 4 Highland Families after seeing a need in her own community of Silver Spring, MD. Community service and social justice have been a big part of her life for as long as she can remember, and she aims to pass those values on to her daughter and the next generation. Becca has worked for the cyber security team at American University for the last ten years, and recently left to pursue something new. She vows to stand up against injustice wherever it presents itself and has been the driving force keeping F4HF operating and helping those less fortunate than her.
