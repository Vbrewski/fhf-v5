---

The pandemic has disrupted life for everyone, but it has had a particularly harsh impact on our neighbors in need – many of whom were already struggling with access to healthy and nutritious meals. We aim to provide our families with a moment of healing and hope that helps address kids’ emotional needs as well as their physical ones. Please support our mission in whatever way you can to keep our children happy and healthy!

Our Mission: Support small businesses in our community and safely deliver nourishing meals to our children and neighbors who need them the most
